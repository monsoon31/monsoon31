## 🚀 About Me
I’m an IT Infrastructure & Support professional transitioning into **DevOps, Cloud Engineering, and AI development**.  
I love building **real-world systems**, automating infrastructure, and designing workflows that scale — from PHP/MySQL applications to containerized microservices and Kubernetes deployments.

I use GitHub as my engineering playground for:
- 🔹 DevOps pipelines (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions)  
- 🔹 Docker & Kubernetes home-lab projects  
- 🔹 PHP full-stack apps (AdminLTE UI)  
- 🔹 Cloud Support engineering (Linux, monitoring, troubleshooting)  
- 🔹 AI integration experiments

### 🔹 **DevOps Home Lab – Kubernetes + ArgoCD + CI/CD**
End-to-end DevOps pipeline:  
Azure DevOps → Docker Hub → ArgoCD → Kubernetes cluster (KIND).  
Microservices used: vote, result, worker (Python, Node.js, .NET).  
Demonstrates CI/CD, containerization, GitOps, scaling, deployments.

---

### 🔹 **Linux Server Automation Scripts**
A growing collection of Bash scripts for:  
- System health checks  
- Log diagnostics  
- MySQL backup  
- NGINX status  
- Service recovery automation  
Useful for real-world Cloud Support roles.
